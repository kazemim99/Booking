## Dependencies & Parallelization Notes
- Tasks 1.1-1.4 (Domain layer) must complete before 2.3 (EF Core config) and 3.x (Application layer)
- Tasks 2.1-2.2 (Storage and optimization services) can be developed in parallel with 1.x (Domain layer)
- Tasks 3.x (Application layer) depend on 1.x and 2.x completing
- Tasks 4.x (API layer) depend on 3.x completing
- Tasks 5.x-7.x (Frontend) can start in parallel with backend tasks 3.x-4.x using mock data initially
- Tasks 8.x (Testing) should run incrementally as features are completed
- Tasks 9.x-10.x (Deployment) are sequential and must happen after all development tasks

## Estimated Timeline
- Backend (Tasks 1-4): 2 weeks
- Frontend (Tasks 5-7): 2 weeks
- Testing & Documentation (Tasks 8-9): 1 week
- Deployment & UAT (Task 10): 1 week
- **Total: 4-6 weeks** (depending on team size and parallelization)
