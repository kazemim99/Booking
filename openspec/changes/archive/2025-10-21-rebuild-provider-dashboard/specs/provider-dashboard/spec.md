## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Dark Theme Support

### Requirement: Dashboard Language Switcher
**Reason**: Language switcher should remain in global header/navigation only, not within the dashboard view itself.

**Migration**: Remove any language switcher UI from the dashboard view. Language switching functionality remains available in the main application header.
