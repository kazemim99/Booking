## 🔧 Remaining Tasks

### 1. **Routing Configuration**
**Action Required**: Update `src/core/router/routes/provider.routes.ts`

```typescript
// Add this route
{
  path: '/provider/register',
  name: 'ProviderRegistration',
  component: () => import('@/modules/provider/views/registration/ProviderRegistrationView.vue'),
  meta: {
    requiresAuth: true, // User must be logged in via phone verification
    title: 'Provider Registration',
  },
},
```

### 2. **Post-Login Routing Logic**
**Action Required**: Update phone verification success handler

**File**: `src/modules/auth/composables/usePhoneVerification.ts` or login logic

Add logic to check if user is a Provider:
```typescript
const redirectAfterVerification = async (user) => {
  // Check if user has Provider role
  if (user.roles.includes('Provider')) {
    // Check if Provider profile exists
    const providerExists = await checkProviderProfile(user.id)

    if (!providerExists) {
      // Redirect to registration
      router.push({ name: 'ProviderRegistration' })
    } else {
      // Redirect to dashboard
      router.push({ name: 'ProviderDashboard' })
    }
  } else {
    // Regular user flow
    router.push({ name: 'Home' })
  }
}
```

### 3. **i18n Translations**
**Action Required**: Add translations to `src/locales/en.json` and `src/locales/ar.json`

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **No Backend Changes**: As requested, all backend logic remains unchanged. You'll need to implement the endpoints when ready.

2. **Phone Verification First**: Users must complete phone verification before accessing registration.

3. **Single Category Selection**: Only one business category can be selected (as per your answer).

4. **Minimum One Service**: At least one service must be added (as per your answer).

5. **Staff Emails After Approval**: Team member verification emails are sent after admin approval (as per your answer).

6. **Draft Saving**: Only on user action, not automatic (as per your answer).

7. **Pending Status**: Provider status is set to "Pending" after registration completion, requiring admin approval.

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Add routing and translations
2. **Short-term**: Implement API endpoints and connect composable
3. **Medium-term**: Enhance BusinessHoursStep with full modal functionality
4. **Long-term**: Add map integration, service suggestions, image uploads
