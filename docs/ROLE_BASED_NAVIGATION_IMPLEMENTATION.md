# Role-Based Navigation Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document describes the complete implementation of role-based navigation for the AsanRezerve provider dashboard. The system now properly differentiates between **Organizations**, **Staff Members**, and **Independent Individuals**, showing appropriate navigation menus and restricting access based on provider type.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**UX Issue:** Previously, all providers (Organizations, Individual Staff, and Freelancers) saw the same dashboard navigation, which was confusing and inappropriate:

- **Staff members** could see organization management features
- **Staff members** could access staff management (which they shouldn't)
- **Everyone** saw options irrelevant to their role

**Solution:** Implement role-based navigation that shows different menus and restricts access based on `hierarchyType` and `parentProviderId`.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Provider Types

```typescript
enum HierarchyType {
  Organization = 'Organization',  // Can manage staff
  Individual = 'Individual',      // Staff member or freelancer
}
```

### Three User Personas

1. **Organization** (`hierarchyType: 'Organization'`)
   - Business owner who can hire and manage staff
   - Full access to all management features

2. **Staff Member** (`hierarchyType: 'Individual'` AND `parentProviderId != null`)
   - Individual provider linked to an organization
   - Limited to personal data only

3. **Independent Individual** (`hierarchyType: 'Individual'` AND `parentProviderId == null`)
   - Freelancer with full control over own business
   - No staff management features

---

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### Frontend Files Created

#### 1. Route Guards
**File:** `asanrezerve-frontend/src/core/router/guards/hierarchy.guard.ts`

Created three route guards:
- `organizationOnlyGuard` - Restricts routes to organizations only
- `staffMemberOnlyGuard` - Restricts routes to staff members only
- `independentIndividualOnlyGuard` - Restricts routes to independent individuals only

**Key Features:**
- Async guards that load hierarchy data if needed
- Proper error handling and redirection
- Helper functions for role checking

#### 2. Staff Member Views
Created 4 new views for staff members:

**a) MyBookingsView.vue** (`asanrezerve-frontend/src/modules/provider/views/staff/MyBookingsView.vue`)
- Shows only bookings assigned to the staff member
- Placeholder for future booking list implementation

**b) MyEarningsView.vue** (`asanrezerve-frontend/src/modules/provider/views/staff/MyEarningsView.vue`)
- Shows staff member's personal earnings only
- Stats cards for earnings overview
- Placeholder for earnings chart

**c) MyProfileView.vue** (`asanrezerve-frontend/src/modules/provider/views/staff/MyProfileView.vue`)
- Staff member's personal profile
- Displays: Name, Contact, Bio, Specializations
- Shows parent organization name
- Read-only initially (edit coming soon)

**d) MyOrganizationView.vue** (`asanrezerve-frontend/src/modules/provider/views/staff/MyOrganizationView.vue`)
- READ-ONLY view of parent organization
- Shows organization details
- Lists other staff members
- Clear notice that changes require manager approval

### Frontend Files Modified

#### 3. Navigation Component
**File:** `asanrezerve-frontend/src/modules/provider/components/dashboard/DashboardLayout.vue`

**Changes:**
- Added role-based menu computed property
- Different menu items for each provider type
- Added role indicator badge to header
- Loads hierarchy data on mount

**Menu Structure:**

**Organization Menu:**
```typescript
- 📊 داشبورد (Dashboard)
- 📅 رزروها (Bookings) - ALL org bookings
- 💰 مالی (Financial) - Organization finances
- 👥 پرسنل (Staff Management) ← ONLY FOR ORGANIZATIONS
- 🏢 پروفایل سازمان (Organization Profile)
```

**Staff Member Menu:**
```typescript
- 📊 داشبورد (Dashboard)
- 📅 رزروهای من (My Bookings) ← Only THEIR bookings
- 💰 درآمد من (My Earnings) ← Only THEIR earnings
- 👤 پروفایل من (My Profile)
- 🏢 سازمان من (My Organization) ← READ-ONLY
```

**Independent Individual Menu:**
```typescript
- 📊 داشبورد (Dashboard)
- 📅 رزروها (Bookings)
- 💰 مالی (Financial)
- 👤 پروفایل من (My Profile)
```

#### 4. Provider Routes
**File:** `asanrezerve-frontend/src/core/router/routes/provider.routes.ts`

**Changes:**
- Imported hierarchy guards
- Added `beforeEnter: organizationOnlyGuard` to `/provider/staff`
- Added `beforeEnter: independentIndividualOnlyGuard` to `/provider/convert-to-organization`
- Added 4 new staff-only routes:
  - `/provider/my-bookings` (staffMemberOnlyGuard)
  - `/provider/my-earnings` (staffMemberOnlyGuard)
  - `/provider/my-profile` (staffMemberOnlyGuard)
  - `/provider/my-organization` (staffMemberOnlyGuard)

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### 1. Role Badge
A visual indicator in the header shows the user's role:

```typescript
Role Badges:
- "سازمان" (Organization) - Blue badge
- "کارمند" (Staff Member) - Yellow badge
- "فردی" (Independent) - Purple badge
```

**CSS Classes:**
- `.badge-organization` - Blue (#dbeafe background, #1e40af text)
- `.badge-staff` - Yellow (#fef3c7 background, #92400e text)
- `.badge-individual` - Purple (#e0e7ff background, #4338ca text)

### 2. Contextual Menu Labels
- Organizations see "رزروها" (All Bookings)
- Staff see "رزروهای من" (My Bookings)

### 3. Graceful Fallback
If hierarchy data hasn't loaded yet, shows minimal menu with just Dashboard.

---

## 🔐 Security & Access Control

### Route-Level Protection
```typescript
// Example: Staff Management Route
{
  path: '/provider/staff',
  name: 'ProviderStaffManagement',
  beforeEnter: organizationOnlyGuard,  // ← Prevents staff from accessing
}
```

### Navigation-Level Filtering
- Menu items are computed based on `hierarchyType` and `parentProviderId`
- Users never see menu items they can't access
- Better UX than showing disabled items

### Guard Flow
1. Check if hierarchy data is loaded
2. Load hierarchy if needed (calls API)
3. Validate user's `hierarchyType` and `parentProviderId`
4. Allow/deny access and redirect accordingly
5. Show friendly error message if denied

---

## 📊 Backend Integration

### API Endpoints
The backend already supports hierarchy fields:

**GET /api/v1/providers/by-owner/{ownerId}**
Returns:
```json
{
  "id": "guid",
  "businessName": "...",
  "hierarchyType": "Organization" | "Individual",
  "isIndependent": true | false,
  "parentProviderId": "guid or null",
  "parentOrganization": {
    "providerId": "guid",
    "businessName": "...",
    "profileImageUrl": "...",
    "status": "Active"
  }
}
```

### Backend Files (Already Configured)
✅ `ProviderDto.cs` - Has hierarchy fields (lines 28-31)
✅ `ProviderMappingProfile.cs` - Maps hierarchy fields (lines 22-24)
✅ `ProviderDetailsResponse.cs` - Exposes hierarchy to API (lines 36-60)
✅ `ProvidersController.cs` - Maps response correctly (lines 1192-1211)

   - Fine-grained permissions beyond role types
   - Manager role (can manage staff but isn't owner)
   - Custom permission sets

2. **Role Transitions**
   - Independent → Organization (conversion flow)
   - Staff → Independent (leave organization)

3. **Multi-Organization Support**
   - Staff member works for multiple organizations
   - Switch between organizations

### Long Term
1. **Advanced Access Control**
   - Resource-level permissions
   - Time-based access
   - Delegation system

2. **Analytics**
   - Role-based analytics dashboards
   - Comparative metrics
   - Team performance tracking

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Bookings/Earnings Views are Placeholders**
   - Need backend API to filter by staff member
   - Waiting for booking assignment system

2. **No Edit Functionality Yet**
   - Staff profile editing to be implemented
   - Need to define what staff can/cannot edit

3. **Single Organization Only**
   - Staff can only belong to one organization
   - Multi-org support requires schema changes

### Potential Issues
1. **Cache Timing**
   - Hierarchy data cached for 5 minutes
   - Role changes might not reflect immediately
   - **Solution:** Clear cache or restart API

2. **Concurrent Sessions**
   - User logged in as org and staff in different tabs
   - Could cause confusion
   - **Solution:** Session isolation or warning

## 📚 Technical Reference

### Key Computed Properties

```typescript
// DashboardLayout.vue
const menuItems = computed(() => {
  const provider = currentHierarchy.value?.provider
  const hierarchyType = provider?.hierarchyType
  const hasParentOrg = !!provider?.parentOrganizationId

  if (hierarchyType === HierarchyType.Organization) {
    return organizationMenu
  }

  if (hierarchyType === HierarchyType.Individual && hasParentOrg) {
    return staffMemberMenu
  }

  if (hierarchyType === HierarchyType.Individual && !hasParentOrg) {
    return independentMenu
  }

  return defaultMenu
})
```

### Guard Implementation Pattern

```typescript
export const organizationOnlyGuard = async (to, _from, next) => {
  const hierarchyStore = useHierarchyStore()

  // Ensure hierarchy loaded
  if (!hierarchyStore.currentHierarchy) {
    await hierarchyStore.loadProviderHierarchy(providerId)
  }

  // Check hierarchy type
  const provider = hierarchyStore.currentHierarchy?.provider
  if (provider?.hierarchyType !== HierarchyType.Organization) {
    return next({ name: 'Forbidden', params: { message: '...' } })
  }

  next()
}
```
